## Features

*Note*: The application is not release quality at this time. You will encounter
build issues, bugs, and incomplete or non-working features. That said, please
feel free to create an issue with your problem and I will do my best to triage
it.

* Individually control lights (brightness, color, on/off, effects)
* Manage and control individual groups (brightness, color, on/off, effects)
* Create new and modify existing groups (stored on the bridge, not on your computer)
* Bridge information and management (rescan for lights, check for updates)
